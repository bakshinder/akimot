=== Actual ===
[4,hash] position hashing - add moveIndex - now earlier move kills later move
[4,board] refactor steps - divide steps to singlesteps pushpulls, killsNum initialization needs optimalization
[3,eval] mapping evaluation -> win percentage is dummy -> improve
  === Done  ===
  [5,gen] implement hashing and step correctness check in uct 
  [5,gen] prepare for matchOffline with other bots ( add configuration from file/options ) 

=== Small Issues ===
[3,board-hash] move playerSignatures to board and update it in commitMove ? 

=== Long Term Ideas === 
[uct] check and optimize ( pointers vs. objects, ... )
