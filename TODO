# akimot todo file 
# [urgency, category] item 

=== Actual ===
[5, uct] remove tactical code from uct::playout -> move to method
[4, uct] tree merge is inconsistent with nodesNum count (because of TT)
[4, uct] virtual passes and semi passes and inverse steps handling in uct (handle in TT)?
[4, eval] relative position evaluation - now in good positions program stops playing 
[3, board] optimize step comparison
[3, uct] review code and remove unneccesarry stuff (i.e. removeChild method)

  === Done  ===
  [5,gen] implement hashing and step correctness check in uct 
  [5,gen] prepare for matchOffline with other bots ( add configuration from file/options ) 
  [3, uct] node which cannot expand must be deleted straightaway
  [5,log] refactor logging through macro ! 
  [3, uct] remove node consistency - is it working properly ? 
  [28.11][4,uct] thirdRep still has issues - needs testing ! ( failed assert positionVisited < 2 )  
  [29.11][4,aei] add init from file 
  [29.11][5,config] refactor not to use config, but only aei 
  [10.12][5,*] smoothen headers (privatexpublic, comments)
  [12.12][5, board] create class for Move ( list of steps )
  [14.12][5, board] refactor quickGoalCheck and backtrackFlagBoard
         [2, board] makeMove method -> initstep from string & board->makestepwithcommit + tests !!!
  [3, board] randomness too slow in choosestepwithknowledge
  [3, eval] mapping evaluation -> win percentage is dummy -> improve
  [4, hash] position hashing - add moveIndex - now earlier move kills later move
  [5, eval] make values init global 

  === Won't do ===
  [4, board] refactor steps - divide steps to singlesteps pushpulls, killsNum initialization needs optimalization
  [5, board] pieceArray lazy delete ! 
  [3, board] get frozenboard back to work
  [3, bench] add more positions to benchmark ! 
  [3, hash] undumiffy hash table (don't use map, but real hashtable)
  [3, uct] change treeWideSteps from map to hashtable ! 

=== Small Issues ===
[3,board-hash] move playerSignatures to board and update it in commitMove ? 
[1, uct]  history has a fixed size - change to dynamic + reallocation
  === Done  ===
  [28.11][3, uct] node removal still has issues (cascade removal, recalculating values, root removal)
  [29.11][3, uct] time control should be part of engine not uct 
  [29.11][3. board] makestep should be private
  [02.01][3, board] what is testpiecearray doing ? deleted
         [3,board] refactor board loading - use fromcompactstring

  === Won't do ===
  [1, *] add init to repository

=== Long Term Ideas === 
[uct] check and optimize ( pointers vs. objects, ... ) 
[uct] uctDescend should be FAST ( unlike now :( )
