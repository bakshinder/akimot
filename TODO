# akimot todo file 
# [urgency, category] item 

=== Actual ===
[5,config] refactor to use only aei 
[5,*] reorganize headers 
[3,board] refactor board loading - use fromcompactstring
[4,hash] position hashing - add moveIndex - now earlier move kills later move
[4,board] refactor steps - divide steps to singlesteps pushpulls, killsNum initialization needs optimalization
[3,eval] mapping evaluation -> win percentage is dummy -> improve
[3, board] get frozenboard back to work

  === Done  ===
  [5,gen] implement hashing and step correctness check in uct 
  [5,gen] prepare for matchOffline with other bots ( add configuration from file/options ) 
  [3, uct] node which cannot expand must be deleted straightaway
  [5,log] refactor logging through macro ! 
  [3, uct] remove node consistency - is it working properly ? 
  [4,uct] thirdRep still has issues - needs testing ! ( failed assert positionVisited < 2 )  

=== Small Issues ===
[3,board-hash] move playerSignatures to board and update it in commitMove ? 
[3, uct] node removal still has issues (cascade removal, recalculating values, root removal)
         this is difficult to test (positions with almost no moves to play)
[1, uct]  history has a fixed size - change to dynamic + reallocation
[3. uct] time control should be part of engine not uct 
[3. board] makestep should be private

=== Long Term Ideas === 
[uct] check and optimize ( pointers vs. objects, ... ) 
[uct] uctDescend should be FAST ( now slow :( )
